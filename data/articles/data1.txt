Yet, in Malfurions's head suddenly came a voice...not the voice from within the portal, but rather that of the mysterious Krasus, who Malfurion had long thought had abandoned him.
 
Malfurion...our strength is your strength...as you did in the crystal, draw upon the love and friendship of those who know you...and draw from the determination of those like myself, who stand with them for you.
 
Not all of what he said made perfect sense to the night elf, but the essence of it was clear. He sensed not only Tyrande and Krasus, but also Brox now. The three opened up their minds, their souls to Malfurion, giving to him whatever strength he needed.
